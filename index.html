        <h3 class="post-title">How to write an argumentative essay</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>When attempting to improve any skillset, the first thing you need is determination. Writing an argumentative essay is, really, quite simple. While everyone does have different techniques, I always recommend to write a plan, if you're not too confident; however, I never write one.</p>
          <p>In order to write said essay, you need to have a very clear stance, as well as a coherent structure in your head, or in the form of a plan. </p>
          <p>The basic structure consists of a rather general introduction, where you discuss the topic (or give some background information). Depending on the length of your essay, the intro shouldn't be too long. For example, in a 500 word essay, the intro should take up 50-70 words. <em>A little tip</em>, if you have no idea where to start with your intro, just skip it for now, and jump ahead to the body, or even the conclusion. How can you know what you're introducing if you haven't written the anything yet? I do recommend writing the conclusion first, sometimes, as it is basically a summary of the whole essay, which is what you normally lay down in your plan. I call this the 'backwards method'.</p>
          <p>Since you are defending a certain position, don't forget to mention the opposing view. This will demonstrate, that you have done youre rersearch and are not completely biased, as well as showing that you realise, your position is nothing, but your own opinion, backed by research and facts. Don't spend too much time on this, though. What I also recommend is choosing a rather weak, yet still valid opposing point of view, which you can argue with easily.</p>
          <p>Now, here comes your thesis statement, which is the most important part of your essay, as anything you write after must refer back to your thesis. Of course, it can be changed as much as you wish throughout the process. The obly danger with changing the thesis too much is that your essay might end up having nothing to do with your thesis.</p>
          <p>After you have settled on a thesis, I recommend creating a roadmap which, just like your thesis, can be changed. A roadmap is basically your plan in a few sentences, where you state what you will argue/discuss/state/prove/etc. in the following paragraphs. You can skip the roadmap, if the plan is evident from your thesis.</p>
          <p>You can now get right into the body of the essay. This is pretty simple, as all you have to do is follow your roadmap. In an argumentative essay, try to avoid words, such as "discuss," "talk about," or any others of a non-argumentative nature. Instead, go for "argue," "explore," "demonstrate," "expose," etc. as they convey that you know what you're doing and talking about. <strong>DO NOT FORGET</strong> to include a lot of evidence, facts. Reference everything you write. Avoid using vague and ambiguous statements, such as "some think," or "it is suggested," without providing solid evidence of who thinks 'that', who 'it is suggested' by. Rather, state the author of the research you are using straight away, "John Smith's research suggests that," "As shown through NASA's research," etc. or "Writing argumentative essays is easy. (Smith, 2018)." (Note: I use an <a href="http://www.apastyle.org/">APA format</a>. Make sure you follow the format and the guidelines provided by your teacher/professor.)</p>
          <p>Lastly, you write the conclusion, unless you go for my 'backwards method'. Here you summarise your essay. It is important to never introduce new ideas in the conclusion.</p>
